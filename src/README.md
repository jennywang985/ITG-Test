Frontend Technical Test ITG [www.itg.co.uk](http://www.itg.co.uk/)

### Task Instructions

The task is to build a simple Angular app using the latest Angular framework. You should build the app using current frontend development best practices.

Designs have been provided in the /designs folder for a simple view that displays images of cars along with some basic sales information relevant to each vehicle displayed. Designs have been provided for how the view should look when viewed in a desktop, mobile and tablet browser. It is not necessary to demonstrate this working on a mobile or tablet device, but you need to be able to demonstrate how the view would adapt for each device type. 

Using the APIs detailed below, traverse the API data to dynamically build the views according to the design.

Images for each vehicle returned in the API data can be found in the /images folder.

Time permitting please include unit or e2e tests using a test framework of your choice.

Please provide a copy of the code that you produce for review and any specific details required to install and serve the code.
